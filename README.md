The name of our new revised system is ChillaX. We aim to implement a simplified version of relaX using [LANGUAGE].

Our system includes a parser that reads definitions of relations in text form, and then performs a conversion into a suitable data structure.

The parser also parses queries and maps them into appropriate sequences of ordered operations.

Our system is also able to hangle numerous operations applied in sequence with the addition of nested operations.
